# Looking through original PEP 8 style guide,  https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008 

'''I leanred about code indentation, and that spaces are preferred indentation method.
I also learned that limiting the editor window width makes it possible to have several
files open side by side, so if I'm working on multiple things that could be helpful!
I don't think we learned much about imports yet, but I now know they should be on separate
lines and always put at the top of the file. There is also an order imports should be grouped 
by; the first is standard library imports, the second related third party imports, the third 
and last, local application/library specific imports. '''
