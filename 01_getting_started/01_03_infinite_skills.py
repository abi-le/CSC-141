#Infinite skills

'''
1) I would build a program that allows you to create emojis that describe exactly how you are feeling by a description. You would have a little search bar that you can put in descriptive words, and then an emoji would be generated to fit the descriptive words.
  
2) A blocker for social media platforms that parents can use so that their kids are not exposed to things they should not see at a young age. The program would sift through all the media, pictures, videos, etc on the kids account. 
     
3) Also maybe a game of some sort, not sure about details, but I ran out of ideas. '''
