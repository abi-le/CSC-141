#Made a list of pizzas and printed a sentence with each element in the loop. I follwed the instructions in the book, and used my prior knowledge from class about printing and for loops. 




pizzas = ['Pepperoni', 'Bacon', 'Cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)


pizzas = ['Pepperoni', 'Bacon', 'Cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(f"\nI like {pizza.title()} pizza.\n")


print(f"\nI really love pizza!\n")
